# ChatGPT Table of Contents Extension

A Chrome extension that automatically generates and displays a table of contents for ChatGPT conversations in a convenient right sidebar.

## Features

- **Automatic TOC Generation**: Automatically detects headings (H1-H6) in ChatGPT responses
- **Smart Navigation**: Click any TOC item to jump directly to that section
- **Real-time Updates**: TOC updates automatically as new content is generated
- **Visual Feedback**: Highlights the target section when navigating
- **Operation Friendly**: Allow users to collapse sections in TOC

## Installation

### Method 1: Load as Unpacked Extension (Recommended for Development)

1. **Download or Clone** this repository to your local machine
2. **Open Chrome** and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. **Enable Developer Mode** by toggling the switch in the top-right corner
4. **Click "Load unpacked"** and select the folder containing this extension
5. **Navigate to ChatGPT** at `https://chat.openai.com/`
6. **Look for the "📋 TOC" button** in the top-right corner of the page

### Method 2: Install from Chrome Web Store (When Available)

- **Navigate to [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/jjpmfdjghngpncajeffgdpfcedlpkdmg?utm_source=item-share-cb)**
- **Install the Extension** by clicking "Add to Chrome" button
- **Navigate to ChatGPT** at `https://chat.openai.com/`
- **Look for the "📋 TOC" button** in the top-right corner of the page

## Usage

1. **Open ChatGPT** and start a conversation
2. **Wait for the response** to be generated
3. **Click the "📋 TOC" button** in the top-right corner to open the sidebar
4. **Browse the table of contents** - headings are automatically detected and organized
5. **Click any TOC item** to jump to that section in the conversation
6. **Close the sidebar** by clicking the "×" button or the toggle button again

## How It Works

The extension:

1. **Monitors the page** for new content using MutationObserver
2. **Scans for headings** in ChatGPT assistant responses using multiple selectors
3. **Filters content** to only include headings from assistant messages
4. **Organizes headings** by their hierarchy (H1-H6) with proper indentation
5. **Provides navigation** with smooth scrolling and visual highlighting

### ChatGPT compatibility and regression tests

The current ChatGPT UI can use `data-markdown-text-style="assistant-message"`
instead of `data-message-author-role="assistant"`. The extension supports both,
uses the preceding user message for each response, and updates the TOC when
messages stream, change, or disappear. Only messages currently present in the
page DOM can be indexed; virtualized history outside the DOM is not fetched.

After editing, reload **ChatGPT Table of Contents** in `chrome://extensions/`,
then refresh the ChatGPT tab. If the installed copy is in another directory,
load this directory as the unpacked extension and disable the old copy.

For regression checks, serve the repository locally:

```sh
python -m http.server 8765 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8765/tests/regression.html`.
The page runs browser tests for current/legacy markup, streaming, navigation,
empty states, target replacement, literal text rendering, and observer loops.

If you encounter any issues or have questions:
1. Open an issue on GitHub
2. Check the browser console for error messages
